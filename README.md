# Duet
Duet is a testbed for using RivuNetpy to create executable neuronal network models. RivuNetpy can be used to create reconstructions of neurons imaged under the microscope. These reconstructions are stored as SWC files. NetPyNE can be used to import these reconstructions and assemble them into bona-fide models. These models can be (1) exported, or (2) run directly via the NEURON simulator.

This repository contains experiments/tools in three categories:
1. Creation of synthetic datasets to test RivuNetpy
2. Assembly of neuronal network models from images
3. Visualizations of networks using BlenderNEURON
